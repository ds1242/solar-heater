  ## About/Description

  This is a quick high level web application that explains how a solar panel takes in heat and warms water to warm up a storage tank.  This is a high level explanation so as a result the match required to calculate the time it takes for this change or how long the system needs to run to warm the tank is not included. 

  ### Assumptions
  * A thermometer is installed in the storage tank. 
  * The pump and thermometer are programmed to turn on when the temperature in the storage tank drops to a certain level.
  * Pump and thermometer are programmed to turn off when temperature is raised to an expected level.
  * There is enough consistent sun and heat to heat up the storage tank.
